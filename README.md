# me
This repository contains the source code for my personal website. It serves as a basic online portfolio showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences. Built with modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or any frameworks you may be using, like React, Vue, etc.), this website provides an interactive and responsive platform to display my work and connect with others.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as inspiration for your own personal projects!
